Overview: 
This particular app will allow users to track on a high scale level their migraine/headaches and the severity.  
It will also track if the user missed an event or took any medication due to their migraine/headaches.

This idea came from the fact that my neurologist gives me paper copies of a migraine log to fill out and return to him every 3 months.
I haven't found any app that has the simplicity of what he wants recorded.  It would be easier for users to record on their phone than 
on paper and then email to him.

Features: 
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Create Post: Users will be able to add comments for the day, to offer feedback for the doctor on why a day went bad. 
New posts will appear in the user’s profile.
Feature 3?

Technologies: 
JavaScript
BootStrap
?

What you’ll have to learn: 
Continue to enrich my JavaScript knowledge.  Figure out how to create a monthly grid of data for reporting.
Would like to have the ability to share the data either via printing or emailing, so the user can share with their doctor.
